Brotherly Locations is a user-friendly web app that allows the user to effortlessly track the approximate whereabouts with their children/brothers. 
Simply click on each name to reveal vague location images such as 'home', 'desert', 'beach', and more, fostering a sense of connection and adventure among siblings.

This is a fun side project
